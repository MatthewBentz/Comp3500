Separate compilation is demonstrated using the following multiple source code files.
The following eight (8) source code files are derived from input.c

(1) open.h
(2) open.c
(3) read.h
(4) read.c
(5) print.h
(6) print.c
(7) scheduler.h
(8) scheduler.c

How to manually compile the above multiple source code files?
$gcc -c open.c
$gcc -c read.c
$gcc -c print.c
$gcc open.o read.o print.o scheduler.c -o scheduler

How to run the executable file - scheduler?
$./scheduler task.list

How to compile using the Makefile?
$make
